Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage.

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

I would like for that back up to be someone that was NOT on your original team. This may help us address the issue of the two ""old"" teams merging. For example I am assuming if one rep has the shipper business and another rep has the operator business for the same company, then those two reps should back each other's desk. Randy Janzen is backing up Jean Adams desk on Lamar Power Plant since he has AEP which is shipper that does business at the Lamar Plant. Scott and Kathy support each other's desk since Kathy has ElPaso as a Shipper and Scott has ElPaso as Operator. Harry and Joe support each other on Oneok since Harry has Bushton and Joe has the gathering The areas of concern in relation to day to day business are below and need specific back up reps.

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method.

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border. If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer. -----Original Message----- From: Brown, Elizabeth Sent: Saturday, September 22, 2001 10:58 PM To: Watson, Kimberly; Blair, Lynn; Dietz, Rick; Donoho, Lindy Subject: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

I would like for that back up to be someone that was NOT on your original team. This may help us address the issue of the two ""old"" teams merging. For example I am assuming if one rep has the shipper business and another rep has the operator business for the same company, then those two reps should back each other's desk.

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

If you have any questions, please let me know. -----Original Message----- From: Hanagriff, Richard Sent: Monday, September 24, 2001 11:30 AM To: Blair, Lynn Subject: RE: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues. One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border. If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer. -----Original Message----- From: Brown, Elizabeth Sent: Saturday, September 22, 2001 10:58 PM To: Watson, Kimberly; Blair, Lynn; Dietz, Rick; Donoho, Lindy Subject: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

If you have any questions, please let me know. -----Original Message----- From: Hanagriff, Richard Sent: Monday, September 24, 2001 11:30 AM To: Blair, Lynn Subject: RE: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues. One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border. If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer. -----Original Message----- From: Brown, Elizabeth Sent: Saturday, September 22, 2001 10:58 PM To: Watson, Kimberly; Blair, Lynn; Dietz, Rick; Donoho, Lindy Subject: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

If you have any questions, please let me know. -----Original Message----- From: Hanagriff, Richard Sent: Monday, September 24, 2001 11:30 AM To: Blair, Lynn Subject: RE: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues. One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border. If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer. -----Original Message----- From: Brown, Elizabeth Sent: Saturday, September 22, 2001 10:58 PM To: Watson, Kimberly; Blair, Lynn; Dietz, Rick; Donoho, Lindy Subject: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

If you have any questions, please let me know. -----Original Message----- From: Hanagriff, Richard Sent: Monday, September 24, 2001 11:30 AM To: Blair, Lynn Subject: RE: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues. One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border. If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer. -----Original Message----- From: Brown, Elizabeth Sent: Saturday, September 22, 2001 10:58 PM To: Watson, Kimberly; Blair, Lynn; Dietz, Rick; Donoho, Lindy Subject: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

If you have any questions, please let me know. -----Original Message----- From: Hanagriff, Richard Sent: Monday, September 24, 2001 11:30 AM To: Blair, Lynn Subject: RE: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues. One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border. If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer. -----Original Message----- From: Brown, Elizabeth Sent: Saturday, September 22, 2001 10:58 PM To: Watson, Kimberly; Blair, Lynn; Dietz, Rick; Donoho, Lindy Subject: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

If you have any questions, please let me know. -----Original Message----- From: Hanagriff, Richard Sent: Monday, September 24, 2001 11:30 AM To: Blair, Lynn Subject: RE: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues. One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border. If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer. -----Original Message----- From: Brown, Elizabeth Sent: Saturday, September 22, 2001 10:58 PM To: Watson, Kimberly; Blair, Lynn; Dietz, Rick; Donoho, Lindy Subject: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

If you have any questions, please let me know. -----Original Message----- From: Hanagriff, Richard Sent: Monday, September 24, 2001 11:30 AM To: Blair, Lynn Subject: RE: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues. One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border. If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer. -----Original Message----- From: Brown, Elizabeth Sent: Saturday, September 22, 2001 10:58 PM To: Watson, Kimberly; Blair, Lynn; Dietz, Rick; Donoho, Lindy Subject: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

If you have any questions, please let me know. -----Original Message----- From: Hanagriff, Richard Sent: Monday, September 24, 2001 11:30 AM To: Blair, Lynn Subject: RE: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues. One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border. If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer. -----Original Message----- From: Brown, Elizabeth Sent: Saturday, September 22, 2001 10:58 PM To: Watson, Kimberly; Blair, Lynn; Dietz, Rick; Donoho, Lindy Subject: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

If you have any questions, please let me know. -----Original Message----- From: Hanagriff, Richard Sent: Monday, September 24, 2001 11:30 AM To: Blair, Lynn Subject: RE: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues. One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border. If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer. -----Original Message----- From: Brown, Elizabeth Sent: Saturday, September 22, 2001 10:58 PM To: Watson, Kimberly; Blair, Lynn; Dietz, Rick; Donoho, Lindy Subject: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

If you have any questions, please let me know. -----Original Message----- From: Hanagriff, Richard Sent: Monday, September 24, 2001 11:30 AM To: Blair, Lynn Subject: RE: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues. One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border. If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer. -----Original Message----- From: Brown, Elizabeth Sent: Saturday, September 22, 2001 10:58 PM To: Watson, Kimberly; Blair, Lynn; Dietz, Rick; Donoho, Lindy Subject: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

If you have any questions, please let me know. -----Original Message----- From: Hanagriff, Richard Sent: Monday, September 24, 2001 11:30 AM To: Blair, Lynn Subject: RE: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues. One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border. If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer. -----Original Message----- From: Brown, Elizabeth Sent: Saturday, September 22, 2001 10:58 PM To: Watson, Kimberly; Blair, Lynn; Dietz, Rick; Donoho, Lindy Subject: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

If you have any questions, please let me know. -----Original Message----- From: Hanagriff, Richard Sent: Monday, September 24, 2001 11:30 AM To: Blair, Lynn Subject: RE: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues. One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border. If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer. -----Original Message----- From: Brown, Elizabeth Sent: Saturday, September 22, 2001 10:58 PM To: Watson, Kimberly; Blair, Lynn; Dietz, Rick; Donoho, Lindy Subject: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

If you have any questions, please let me know. -----Original Message----- From: Hanagriff, Richard Sent: Monday, September 24, 2001 11:30 AM To: Blair, Lynn Subject: RE: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues. One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border. If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer. -----Original Message----- From: Brown, Elizabeth Sent: Saturday, September 22, 2001 10:58 PM To: Watson, Kimberly; Blair, Lynn; Dietz, Rick; Donoho, Lindy Subject: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

If you have any questions, please let me know. -----Original Message----- From: Hanagriff, Richard Sent: Monday, September 24, 2001 11:30 AM To: Blair, Lynn Subject: RE: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues. One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border. If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer. -----Original Message----- From: Brown, Elizabeth Sent: Saturday, September 22, 2001 10:58 PM To: Watson, Kimberly; Blair, Lynn; Dietz, Rick; Donoho, Lindy Subject: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

If you have any questions, please let me know. -----Original Message----- From: Hanagriff, Richard Sent: Monday, September 24, 2001 11:30 AM To: Blair, Lynn Subject: RE: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues. One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border. If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer. -----Original Message----- From: Brown, Elizabeth Sent: Saturday, September 22, 2001 10:58 PM To: Watson, Kimberly; Blair, Lynn; Dietz, Rick; Donoho, Lindy Subject: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team. In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges. With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term; 1.) An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access. Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed. The service should be available from remote locations. I am currently investigating this issue. (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 2.) A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information. There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties. The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc. Again it should have remote capabilities. I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers. Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP. Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution."

Question: Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season? Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter."

The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. Critical Business Application: Outlook (Exchange Servers) Mailman.Enron.com Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total) EDI Hub EDI Net VPN PGas TMS CMS CRS Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification: Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building. Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging). Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors. Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland. EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method. Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts."

Procedures need to be documented to handle negative numbers creat= ed by =09=09 the LDC giving measurement an end user actual volume greater tha= n the=20 =09=09 TBS connected to NNG. =09=095. Measurement and Gas Logistics agreed that all measured volumes in= cluding =09=09 End User point volumes would be ""housed' in PGAS. =09After further discussions in Gas Logistics, our recommendation is that n= either Measurement or Gas Logistics accomodate a =09negative number. If the LDC gives measurement an end user volume greate= r than the TBS the following should happen: =09=091. Measurement should either: =09=09=09a. Call the LDC and let them know they cannot accept a volume at = an end =09=09=09 user point higher than their TBS. =09=09=09b. Or Measurement can call Jodie Floyd on the Gas Logistics Measu= rement Desk =09=09=09 and Jodie will call LDC with the same info. =09=092. If Measurement does not get an answer before measurement close, t= hen measurement will =09=09 use the number equal to the TBS for the end user point. =09Gary and Ellis, you may want to have more discussions on this topic. I = would be glad to regroup if you want. =09I have put a call into Marketing to talk to them about our concerns on t= his issue. Also Raetta and Jodie are =09 going to go ahead and call Wisconsin Gas and get their explanation of w= hy an end user point would be =09greater than the TBS. Hopefully it is just a measurement error. We wil= l let you know the outcome. =09If there is something I missed, please let me know. Thanks.

At this time I think the split is OK. I would like for you to put in writing for me the following: Who is your back up on critical reports, etc when you are out. I would like for that back up to be someone that was NOT on your original team. This may help us address the issue of the two ""old"" teams merging. For example I am assuming if one rep has the shipper business and another rep has the operator business for the same company, then those two reps should back each other's desk. Randy Janzen is backing up Jean Adams desk on Lamar Power Plant since he has AEP which is shipper that does business at the Lamar Plant. Scott and Kathy support each other's desk since Kathy has ElPaso as a Shipper and Scott has ElPaso as Operator. Harry and Joe support each other on Oneok since Harry has Bushton and Joe has the gathering The areas of concern in relation to day to day business are below and need specific back up reps. GPM Monthly Pricing Report Lamar Power Plant True Ups PVR Report Oneok Gathering Reporting NNG Administrative Contracts SPS Power Plant True Up Conoco Power Plant True Up MOPS Daily Report The HIgh profile shippers/Operators that need specific back ups are as follows: Duke/GPM Oneok Transcanada Dynegy Reliant ElPaso West Texas Gas If there is any confusion with the email, please do not hesitate to call Terry or myself.
